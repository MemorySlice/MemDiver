# Web UI tour

A guided walk through the React SPA. Each screenshot below is regenerated deterministically by the Playwright harness documented in [](../contributing/index.md) — they stay in sync with the code, not a moving memory.

## Session landing

First screen when you open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Pick a saved session (**Load** / **Delete**) or click **New Session** to open the wizard. If you previously discarded unsaved work, a **Recovered work** entry (badge **RECOVERED**) is pinned to the top of the list — it is the only copy, so delete it deliberately.

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/01_landing.png
:alt: MemDiver session landing page, listing previously saved analysis sessions
:align: center

The session-landing view enumerates `.memdiver` SessionStore entries and offers a "New Session" entry point into the wizard.
```

## Starting a new session

**New Session** in the workspace toolbar (or `Ctrl+N`) resets the workspace. If the workspace has changes that were not saved yet, a **Start a new session?** dialog lists what is at stake (dumps loaded, analysis results, bookmarks) and offers:

- **Save and start new** — saves under the name in **Save as** (default: `<input folder>-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm`) and then resets. Saving under an existing name replaces that session, so when the name matches a saved session the dialog warns *"A session named “…” already exists and will be overwritten."* The saved-session list is fetched each time the dialog opens; if that fetch fails, the warning is simply not shown. The warning does not block saving.
- **Discard and start new** — keeps the discarded workspace as the **Recovered work** session on the landing page, then resets.
- **Cancel**.

A clean workspace resets without asking. Closing or reloading the browser tab with unsaved changes triggers the browser's own "leave this page?" confirmation.

## Wizard — select data

Type a path or click **Browse** to open the file-browser modal.

The browser opens in the folder you last picked from (falling back to your home directory). Click **☆ Favourite** in the path bar to save the current folder; it then reads **Favourited**, and clicking it again removes it. Saved folders appear in the collapsible **Favourites** section — click one to jump there, or hover and press **✕** to remove it. Favourites and the last-browsed folder are stored per user on the server in `~/.memdiver/config.json` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/memdiver/config.json`), next to the upload and oracle directories, so they survive browser resets.

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/02_wizard_select_data.png
:alt: Wizard step one, showing path input and a file-browser modal
:align: center

Accepted input types: a single `.dump` or `.msl` file, a run directory (auto-detected), or a full dataset root.
```

## Wizard — analysis algorithms

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/03_wizard_analysis.png
:alt: Wizard step three, showing the 8-algorithm checkbox grid with availability hints
:align: center

Algorithms unavailable for the selected mode (verification vs exploration) are dimmed. Defaults match the recommended set from [](../algorithms/index.md).
```

## Workspace — default layout

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/04_workspace_default.png
:alt: MemDiver workspace in dark theme, showing hex viewer, sidebar, and bottom analysis panel
:align: center

The IDA-Pro-style dockable workspace: main hex panel, sidebar with six tabs, detail overlay, and a mode-gated bottom-tabs row.
```

## Hex viewer with structure overlay

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/05_hex_with_overlay.png
:alt: Hex viewer with a TLS-13 structure overlay highlighting bytes by classification
:align: center

Structural fields are colored by class (`static`, `dynamic`, `key_material`); overlays drive the investigation panel on the right.
```

The toolbar's search box finds a byte sequence typed as hex, text, UTF-16LE text, base64, or a 32/64-bit integer, and previews the resolved bytes before searching — see [Byte search](../visualizations/hex.md#byte-search) for the accepted formats. With two or more dumps selected, the **Main view layout** switcher offers **Single**, **Side by side**, and **Overlay**.

## Entropy profile

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/06_entropy_tab.png
:alt: Entropy profile chart with Shannon entropy plotted against byte offset and high-entropy regions shaded
:align: center

Sliding-window Shannon entropy: a min–max band per pixel column over every window position, with the maximum drawn as a line so a single key-sized spike stays visible. Shaded regions reach the threshold (default 4.5 bits/byte at the 32-byte window; a 32-byte window can reach at most log2(32) = 5.0, marked as a dashed line). Large dumps show a sampled preview first and refine to full resolution.
```

## Consensus view

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/07_consensus_tab.png
:alt: Consensus view — stacked bars showing per-byte classification counts across N dumps
:align: center

Consensus over multiple dumps from the same library and phase. Classification bands: `INVARIANT`, `STRUCTURAL`, `POINTER`, `KEY_CANDIDATE`.
```

The same consensus vector can be painted onto the hex bytes: switch the main view to **Overlay**, then use the **Regions** tab to list runs by class, filter them to an exact key size (`16 B`, `24 B`, `32 B`, `48 B`) and sort **Longest first**. See [Hex overlay](../visualizations/consensus.md#hex-overlay).

## Pipeline — wizard

The **pipeline** bottom tab is a six-step wizard: **Recipe** → **Dumps** → **Oracle** → **Thresholds** → **Run** → **Results**.

- **Recipe** — **Start blank** (store defaults) or **Replicate gocryptfs IMF result** (a preset that also turns on the N-sweep).
- **Dumps** — paste paths and **Add paths**, or **Browse folder…**. At least one dump is required; three or more make variance filtering meaningful. Dump 1 is marked **reference**: only its bytes are verified against the oracle.
- **Oracle** — **Upload** a `.py` oracle and **Arm oracle** it, or pick one from **Examples** (**Use this example**; examples that need config ask for it, then offer **Load + arm**). Alternatively, verify against a pcap instead of a BYO oracle. A smoke test (below) checks the oracle before you continue.
- **Thresholds** — search-reduce and brute-force parameters, plus optional **Emit a Volatility 3 plugin from the best hit** and **Run the N-sweep harness and build the interactive report**. **Run pipeline** submits the job.

## Pipeline — oracle smoke test

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/08_pipeline_oracle.png
:alt: Pipeline oracle-stage wizard showing uploaded decryption oracle with dry-run status
:align: center

Upload a bring-your-own decryption oracle (Python module matching the [oracle interface](../oracle/interface.md)), arm it, and smoke-test it before committing to a full sweep.

The smoke test (**Test on 16 samples**) is a *discrimination* test, not a pass count. The server feeds the oracle one candidate it must accept — the master key the run's `meta.json` records — and fifteen it must reject, read at random offsets from the dump itself. The verdict is shown as a sentence; its id (`discriminates`, `accepts_noise`, `never_accepts`, `no_positive_control`, `inconclusive`) is what the API returns. A green **discriminates** verdict means both halves held, and only then does **Continue to Thresholds →** appear. **accepts_noise** means the oracle accepted arbitrary memory and would flood a real sweep with false positives; **never_accepts** means it rejected its own known-good key, so the oracle or its config is wrong. When the dump has no `meta.json` there is no ground truth to test against, and the verdict says **no_positive_control** ("Half-tested") rather than pretending to a result. **inconclusive** means the run did not produce enough clean signal to judge the oracle; check the listed errors.

The positive control uses the dataset's recorded answer key, so it proves the oracle works — it is not itself a finding.
```

## Pipeline — run dashboard

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/09_pipeline_run.png
:alt: Live pipeline run dashboard with funnel chart, stage timings, and live oracle log
:align: center

Stages: `consensus` → `search_reduce` → `brute_force`, then the optional `escalate`, `nsweep`, and `emit_plugin`. The **Reduction funnel** shows candidates surviving each step (Raw → Variance → Aligned → Entropy → Candidates → Verified); the live log streams oracle hits, and **Verified hits** rows offer **Open in hex**.
```

## Pipeline — results

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/10_pipeline_results.png
:alt: Pipeline results with survivor-curve chart and downloadable artifacts
:align: center

Downloadable artifacts include the finalized consensus state (`consensus/state.json`, which points at the Welford `mean.npy` / `m2.npy` arrays written next to it), the variance vector, `search_reduce/candidates.json`, the `brute_force/hits.json` catalog, the N-sweep report, and the synthesized Volatility 3 plugin with its YARA rule. The results view has **Plugin**, **Report**, and **Raw** tabs.
```

## Theme triptych

```{figure} /_static/screenshots/11_theme_triptych.png
:alt: Three workspace panels side by side in light, dark, and dark-plus-high-contrast themes
:align: center

Light, dark, and dark+high-contrast modes. High-contrast mode passes WCAG AAA for text legibility.
```

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+N` | New session |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save the workspace as the session `autosave` |
| `Ctrl+G` | Go to offset |
| `Ctrl+B` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Arrow`, `Shift+Arrow` | Hex navigation / selection |
| `PageUp`, `PageDown` | Page-wise scrolling |
| `Home`, `End` | Start / end of the row; with `Ctrl`, start / end of the file |
| `n`, `p` | Jump to the next / previous region of the class chosen in the **Regions** panel |
| `Tab` | Move focus from the hex to the ASCII column (a second `Tab` leaves the grid) |
| `Esc` | Clear selection / back in wizard |

On macOS, `⌘` works wherever `Ctrl` is listed.

## Guided tours

The first time you reach the workspace a short layout tour runs, followed by a structure-overlay tour; the pipeline tab has its own tour the first time it opens. Dismissed or finished tours are remembered in the browser. Replay one from **Settings** → **Run onboarding tour**.
