/**
 * Two fixture tiers gate the e2e specs:
 *
 *  - SMOKE specs (load an MSL + assert inspect/blocks/tabs render) should
 *    gate on `syntheticMslAvailable` and load `syntheticMslPath`. The
 *    synthetic fixture is committed (see tests/e2e/fixtures/synthetic_msl/
 *    sample.msl, regenerated via generate.py), so `syntheticMslAvailable`
 *    is effectively always true and these flows run on any machine / CI.
 *
 *  - DEEP / analysis specs that need the large real capture keep gating on
 *    `datasetAvailable` and load `MSL` (the private run_0001 dataset). They
 *    skip automatically when the dataset is absent.
 *
 * Both flags coexist; nothing below removes the real-dataset path.
