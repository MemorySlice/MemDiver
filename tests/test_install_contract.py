"""The packaging contract, enforced against the code that depends on it.

MemDiver reports an absent dependency through a soft *import probe*::

    try:
        import yara
        HAS_YARA = True
    except ImportError:
        HAS_YARA = False

That idiom is load-bearing and also silent: the probe degrades so cleanly
that a module can depend on a distribution nobody ever declared, and every
test still passes -- as long as the developer's environment happens to have
the package installed for some *other* project. ``yara-python`` was exactly
that case before it was added to ``[project.dependencies]``.

This test closes the gap structurally. It walks the shipped package for
module-level probes, maps each probed import name onto its distribution name,
and requires that distribution to appear in ``pyproject.toml`` -- either in
the base ``[project.dependencies]`` or in some
``[project.optional-dependencies]`` group. Adding a probe for an undeclared
module therefore fails here instead of passing by accident.

Scope, stated honestly:

* Only **module-level** ``try: import X / except ImportError`` blocks are
  scanned -- the top-level ``HAS_*`` capability-flag idiom the docstring
  above shows. Lazily-guarded imports *inside a function* are out of scope;
  a few of those exist (``scipy`` in ``engine/auto_floor.py``, ``PyYAML`` in
  ``api/routers/structures.py``) and each has a real in-code fallback, so
  widening the scan would be a packaging-policy change, not a test fix.
* Only the directories ``[tool.setuptools] packages`` actually ships are
  scanned. ``scripts/`` and ``tools/`` are dev material that is not
  installed, so a probe there does not create an install-contract debt.
