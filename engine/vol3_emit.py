"""Vol3 plugin emission from brute-force hits.

Takes a hit + its neighborhood variance (the window around a successful
candidate that ``brute-force`` already sliced from the Welford state) and
produces a Python Volatility3 plugin via the existing
architect.Volatility3Exporter.

The window is ``pad + key_length + pad`` where ``pad`` is
``engine.brute_force.DEFAULT_NEIGHBORHOOD_PAD`` (64) unless the caller passed
``--neighborhood-pad`` / ``neighborhood_pad=``: 160 bytes for a 32-byte key at
the default, not 128. (128 is the *total* padding, never a window size.)

The static anchor comes from bytes *around* the hit, not the hit
itself — the key region is ~100% volatile by construction and cannot
yield an anchor. The surrounding struct fields (pointers, flags,
length prefixes) are what make the plugin searchable on an unrelated
dump.
