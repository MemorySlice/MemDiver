"""Heap-role awareness for the search-space reduction (``heap_policy``).

:func:`memdiver.engine.candidate_pipeline.reduce_search_space` takes the
consensus heap annotation (:mod:`memdiver.engine.consensus_heap`) as two
optional inputs — merged role runs and the anchor's chunk index, both in slab
coordinates — and a ``heap_policy``:

``"off"``
    Ignore them; the reduction is exactly what it was before heap roles.
``"annotate"`` (default)
    Every region gets a :func:`region_heap_annotation` dict. The candidate set
    and every score are untouched.
``"mask"``
    Additionally drop bytes whose consensus role is allocator metadata
    (:data:`METADATA_ROLES`) before the reduction, and adjust each region's
    score by :func:`heap_score_adjustment`.

Kept out of ``candidate_pipeline`` so the reduction itself never imports the
heap layer unless a caller hands it heap runs.
