 * wizard stage the user is on, the form values they've filled in, the
 * in-flight task id, live-progress rollups (funnel stage counts,
 * n-sweep survivor curve, timings), verified hits, registered
 * artifacts, and terminal status.
 *
 * State that should survive a tab-switch re-mount (form values,
 * stage, taskId, lastSeq) is persisted to localStorage via Zustand's
 * ``persist`` middleware; live event state (funnel, timings, hits) is
 * not persisted and is recovered on reconnect by two complementary
 * mechanisms. The WebSocket ring buffer replays the last 512 events,
 * which covers a SHORT gap (a tab switch, a blip). It does not cover a
 * long one: a stride-1 brute-force run emits thousands of progress
 * events, so anything older has already been evicted. For that case the
 * canonical ``TaskRecord`` is the source of truth, folded in by
 * ``hydrateFromRecord``.
 *
 * The ``ingestEvent`` reducer translates backend TaskProgressEvents into
 * state deltas. The hook ``useTaskProgress`` wires events into this
 * reducer; ingestEvent itself is pure and trivially unit-testable.

 * at offset 585148 (585148 % 8 === 4) is never handed to the oracle and the
 * run still reports "succeeded, 0 hits" -- indistinguishable from "the key is
 * not in this dump". A browser that had already persisted the form would
 * replay that forever, because ``DEFAULT_FORM`` only applies to a profile with
 * no stored blob. So the one stale value is rewritten in place.
 *
 * Only the exact old default is touched. A hand-picked 2/4/16 was typed
 * deliberately and survives, as does every other saved field: selected dumps,
 * armed oracle/pcap, reduce thresholds, wizard stage, in-flight task id.
 *
 * The spreads over ``DEFAULT_FORM`` also backfill fields added to
 * ``PipelineFormValues`` after a blob was written -- ``partialize`` stores
 * ``form`` wholesale and zustand's default merge is shallow, so without this
 * a newly added nested field rehydrates as ``undefined``.
