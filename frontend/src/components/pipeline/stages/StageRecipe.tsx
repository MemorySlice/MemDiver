/**
 * Stage 0 — recipe picker.
 *
 * For v1 we ship two built-in starting points:
 *
 *  - **Blank**: empty form, user fills in everything. The default for
 *    power users who already know what they're pointing at.
 *  - **Replicate gocryptfs IMF**: pre-populated with the thresholds
 *    from the paper's section 4.2 *and* the N-sweep grid the published
 *    run used, so a peer reviewer can reproduce the published numbers
 *    in one click. The sweep has to be spelled out here because
 *    `NSweepParams` carries its own `key_sizes` / `stride` /
 *    `exhaustive` and inherits none of them from the brute-force
 *    stage — only `reduce_kwargs` is inherited (api/routers/
 *    pipeline.py). Dump paths remain empty — they need to come from
 *    disk.
 *
 * Recipe *save/load* (localStorage + JSON import/export) is deferred
 * to a later sub-phase when `recipe-store.ts` lands. This stage is the
 * placeholder that hooks in cleanly once that store exists.
